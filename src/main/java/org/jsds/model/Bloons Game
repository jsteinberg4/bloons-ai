*****BLOONS TOWER DEFENSE SPEC*****

To Do:





Rules (Invariants):

* Scoring
  - Balloons score by getting across the entire valid path from bottom to top of the board
  - Player scores by depleting a balloons health before it reaches the end of the valid path

* For Balloons
  - Balloons may only travel upon the designated valid path
  - Getting across the entire valid path is calculated when its next move would make it move OFF of the board

* For Players
  - Placement of towers can be anywhere on the board EXCEPT the valid path
  - Can not place a tower with an orientation such that no projectiles that originate from it will miss the entire
    valid path




General Logic (Contained In A Round):

1. Before game completely starts, player chooses where to place first Tower

2. Round Starts

   (Visually)
   3. Balloons will begin moving down the valid path at a specified rate

   4. Projectiles will originate from placed Towers towards the closest Balloon at a specified rate

   (Background)
   5. There will be a check to see if a projectile has hit a balloon at a specified rate

   6. There will be a check to see if a balloon made it across the valid path at a specified rate

   7. There will be a check to see if the round has ended, which is when there are no balloons left

   8. Calculate On Going Score

7. Round Ends

   (Visually)
   8. Remove all remaining projectiles from the state

   9. Place new tower at position specified by the Player
